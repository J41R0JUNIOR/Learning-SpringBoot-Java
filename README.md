# Learning-SpringBoot-Java  

This repository is a **collection of smaller projects** created during my journey of learning **Spring Boot** with **Java**. The goal is to explore different aspects of the framework through hands-on implementations.  

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives  
- Learn and solidify fundamental **Spring Boot** concepts  
- Create small and independent projects for each explored feature  
- Practice **Spring MVC**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Security**, and more  
- Build a strong foundation for backend development with **Java**  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
To run the projects in this repository, make sure you have installed:  
- **Java 17+**  
- **Maven** or **Gradle**  
- An IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**  

### Clone the repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/J41R0JUNIOR/Learning-SpringBoot-Java.git
cd Learning-SpringBoot-Java
```

### Run a Spring Boot project  
Navigate to the desired project directory and run:  
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
# or if using Gradle
./gradlew bootRun
```

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
Each directory contains an independent project covering different aspects of Spring Boot:  
- **01-hello-world/** â†’ First Spring Boot project  
- **02-rest-api/** â†’ Creating RESTful APIs  
- **03-database/** â†’ Database integration using Spring Data JPA  
- **04-security/** â†’ Implementing authentication and authorization  
- **...** (More projects will be added as the learning progresses)
